# Legal-Entity-Ownership-Extraction

## Product overview

Legal entity ownership extraction is an NLP solution that helps identify and classify legal parent and subsidiary organization names in an unstructured text. The solution takes a text file as input. The text can be sourced from documents such as financial statements and legal documents. The solution processes the text to identify all the parent-child organization relationships in the document.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution can be leveraged to solve the problem of identifying parent and subsidiary legal entities from noisy text in legal documents. The input can have a maximum of 50000 characters and gives output as a list of dictionaries containing parent and child organization relationships for the given input.
* The solution uses English text as input and uses pretrained language models & name entity recognition techniques to extract organization tags from a given input text. Relationships are then established between the extracted organizations tags using semantics to find the parent and child entities from the given input text. Presently, our solution can identify organization relationships for English text documents only.
